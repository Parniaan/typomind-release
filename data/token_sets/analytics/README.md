# A Few Things to Note
* these results are from the tokens generated from package names
* english words are **not** removed from this token set
* the wordsegment library is used when generating these tokens, which explains why the token sometimes appears as a substring in the examples
* tokens for this analysis are constrained to have occurred at least twice, have at least two characters, and not be strictly a number
